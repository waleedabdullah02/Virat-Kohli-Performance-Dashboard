# Virat Kohli Performance Dashboard

## Learning Project Overview  
This project represents one of my initial steps into the world of data analysis and visualization. Using Power BI, I explored the batting performance of Virat Kohli from 2008 to 2017 by analyzing various dimensions like runs scored, batting positions, and performance across years, teams, and venues. The objective was to gain hands-on experience in data cleaning, visualization, and dashboard building while learning to communicate insights effectively.

## Project Objectives  
- Explore and analyze Virat Kohliâ€™s batting performance metrics using Power BI.  
- Gain hands-on experience with basic Power BI tools and features.  
- Practice creating effective visualizations for different data types.  
- Learn how to clean and transform raw data into actionable insights.

- **What I Learned:**  
  - Displaying key performance metrics helped me understand how to summarize large datasets into concise, meaningful insights.  
  - Building dynamic KPIs in Power BI introduced me to DAX for calculations.

- **What I Learned:**  
  - Showcasing specific performance metrics like boundaries (4s and 6s) taught me the importance of focusing on granular data points for actionable insights.  
  - Experimented with card visuals in Power BI for simplicity.

- **What I Learned:**  
  - Created a bar chart to track Virat Kohli's yearly performance trends, which helped me practice formatting and labeling visuals effectively.  
  - Understood how to identify patterns in temporal data and communicate them visually.

- **What I Learned:**  
  - Worked with treemaps to show categorical distributions (batting positions).  
  - Learned the value of visualizing categorical data to highlight areas of strength and weakness.

### 5. Runs Against Top 7 Teams 

- ![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dedf2305-3d50-44f4-9608-49c92845d487)
**What I Learned:**  
  - Used pie charts to visualize proportional data, which gave me insight into when such visuals are appropriate for showcasing contributions by different categories (opponent teams in this case).  

---

### 6. Total Runs by Ground (Pie Chart)

- **What I Learned:**  
  - Practiced creating pie charts to display ground-specific performance, experimenting with tooltips to provide additional context.  

---

### 7. Batting Position Filter (Slicer)  
![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cb88d82-2318-4f32-89de-746d7ef5ff2d)

- **What I Learned:**  
  - Created a slicer to make the dashboard interactive, introducing me to filtering techniques in Power BI.  
  - Learned how user interactions can make dashboards more insightful and dynamic.

## Skills Developed  
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Used Power Query to preprocess the dataset (e.g., removing null values and standardizing formats).  
- **Visualization Techniques:** Experimented with visuals like bar charts, pie charts, and treemaps.  
- **Interactivity in Dashboards:** Learned to use slicers for filtering and improving user experience.  
- **Basic DAX:** Calculated metrics like strike rate, total runs, and percentages dynamically.

---

## Lessons Learned  
1. **Understanding the Importance of Data Context:**  
   - Numbers become meaningful only when paired with context; this realization came from analyzing Virat Kohli's metrics like runs scored across different dimensions.  
2. **Visual Hierarchy in Dashboards:**  
   - Ensured that the most important KPIs were immediately visible while supporting details were included in supplementary visuals.  
3. **Iterative Design Process:**  
   - The initial dashboard design went through multiple iterations as I improved the layout and focused on better storytelling with data.
